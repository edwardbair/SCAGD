%SMARTS295Main run SMARTS (Simple Model of Atmospheric Radiative Transfer of Sunshine)
%
%SMARTS is a spectral solar radiation model developed by Christian Gueymard
%distributed by the DOE's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL),
%https://www.nrel.gov/grid/solar-resource/smarts.html.
%It has a huge variety of input options, described in the Documentation
%folder of the folder where SNARTS (current version SMARTS_295_PC) is
%installed.
%To use this interface program, you must download SMARTS. It comes with
%two executable files smarts295.exe, which is interactive, and
%smarts295bat.exe, which runs in batch mode and which this function uses.
%The Fortran source code for SMARTS is included in the download, so you
%could also compile it and call it anything you want. You need to put
%SMARTS in a folder that is writable by all users (sorry, a feature of
%SMARTS when running in batch mode).
%
%The documentation for the SMARTS input is briefly described in the
%accompanying function SetSMARTS295.m (just type 'help SetSMARTS295');
%the SMARTS user manual describes the input possibilities in detail. SMARTS
%also comes with an interactive .xls file that can be used to create an
%inputfile.
%
%Normally SMARTS runs from the input file smarts295.inp.ext, which contains
%the input variables in a prescribed order. This function takes the inputs
%as a set of Name/Value pairs in any order, creates the SMARTS input file,
%runs SMARTS via a system command, and retrieves the output as a structure.
%Included in the output structure is a prescription structure, which can
%also be used as the input to this function, and which can be modified for
%multiple runs of SMARTS with modest changes in the input, using the
%function SMARTS295modify.
%
%Inputs to this function
% smartsHome - the folder where SMARTS is installed
% Optionally, the next argument can be an input prescription structure,
%   perhaps modfied from the output of a previous run of SMARTS.
% Then the rest of the inputs consists of a set of Name/Value pairs to
% describe the SMARTS inputs, as documented in the SetSMARTS295.m code and
% in the SMARTS user's manual.
%
%Output
% outStruct - structure than contains the output, including text and tables,
%
%IMPORTANT: The SMARTS input file and the output files from a run are in
%the smartsHome folder. When this function starts, it overwrites those
%files, so if you want to save them (you normally don't need to) you must
%rename them or move them to a different file. The files that are
%overwritten are: smarts295.inp.txt, smarts295.out.txt, smarts295.ext.txt,
%and smarts295.scn.txt. smarts295.inp.txt and smarts295.out.txt are always
%produced, normally smarts295.ext.txt is produced, and smarts295.scn.txt
%might be depending on inputs.
